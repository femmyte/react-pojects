#My first react project
## it is a Tour app where people see the tour availabe for them to attend and in this app they can filter the one they are not having interest in.
# In this project I was able to lean 
i. Conditional rendering
ii. useState function
iii. useEffect function

I will be updating it as I continue to learn new features
